## Hocus Pocusâ€™s Cakes 
Is a mail-order bakery based in Barcelona, SC known for its distinctly Southern layer cakes and specialty foods made from treasured family recipes. Our legendary caramel cake recipe is a time-honored tradition, made by hand with a delicate process and careful attention to detail. We cut cake, not corners! Our mission is to make the world a smaller, sweet and more gracious place by preserving this tradition that so many generations have honored in their own kitchens.
